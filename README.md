Welcome to the repository for ME 35 in spring 2023! 

Your instructional team (Briana, Kate & Maddie) will be adding code to this repository throughout the semester, and you are welcome to modify and use any code posted here for your projects. It's important to note that none of the code we post will do everything necessary for your projects, but instead is meant to serve as a starting point for you to work from. If you find errors or issues, don't hesitate to correct them and submit a pull request to update the repository for your peers.
