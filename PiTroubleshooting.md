## Raspberry Pi Troubleshooting

### Solid Green Light ###
The green LED on the Pi will come on and off during normal operation. 
If your Pi becomes unresponsive and the green LED is constantly on, then something isn't working properly. 
There are several possible issues that might be happening:
1. If this happens as soon as you plug the Pi in, the Pi is unable to enter into or complete it's boot sequence.
2. Whatever you have asked the Pi to do may be requiring more RAM than the Pi has available.
3. Your SD care may be malfunctioning. 


### Recommended Troubleshooting Steps ###
"Help, I can't talk to my Pi anymore!" 

Step 1: Unplug your Pi and plug it back in - this may resolve some issues entirely such as RAM overload

"Thanks tech support, but I already tried that."

Step 2: If the hardware is showing signs of malfunction (see Solid Green Light above), you have to isolate what might be causing the issue. 

Step 2A: Testing the SD Card

Grab one of the troubleshooting SD cards and replace the SD card in your Pi with the troubleshooting SD card. If that worked, take your SD card and insert it into the troubleshooting Pi. See if you are able to connect to the troubleshooting Pi. If the troubleshooting SD card works in your Pi and your SD card doesn't work in the troubleshooting Pi, then you can conclude that the issue is likely a malfunctioning SD card. You may take the troubleshooting SD card and alert Briana so she can replace it with a new one.
